# Furyctl

## Install
Get the right binary for you in `bin` folder (this will be removed shortly)

## Usage
Write a [`Furyfile.yml`](Furyfile.yml) in the root of your project and then simply run `furyctl`

## Contributing
We still use `dep` as golang package manager. Once you have that installed you can run `dep ensure` and `go build` or `go install` should run without problems
